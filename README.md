# AI-Chatbot-runs-locally
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built with Python and Streamlit, designed to answer questions about uploaded PDF or text files. It uses a local OllamaLLM (`phi` model) for text generation and a FAISS vector store with HuggingFaceEmbeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for document retrieval, which runs fully offline.
